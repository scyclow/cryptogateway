        <div class="question">
          <p><strong>CG: Let's jump right in shall we?</strong></p>

        </div>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            MW: Let's do it!
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <p><strong>CG: Why do artists such as yourself and Steve gravitate towards ArtBlocks? </strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            MW: I can't speak for Steve but personally, I would say ArtBlocks is a great platform with still even more growth to come. They have an incredible founding team who is dedicated and passionate about both the on-chain and art sides. I particularly enjoy the projects coming out of the AB platform and all the artists involved. They are lovely people.           
          </p>
        </div>


        <div class="question">
          <p><strong>
            CG: Nothing but kind words. Are there any other platforms on your radar?
          </strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            MW: There are too many to mention nowadays. Right now I'm thinking about plottables.io, and I'm also learning new things about fx(hash). 
            I feel like other chains, especially tezos, have wonderful communities that I would love to join someday.
          </p>

        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <p><strong>
            CG: Tezos is all the buzz indeed. Before we talk about WTWB, I wanted to ask you a question about "YoursTruly". 
            Was it an airdrop for your DearHash project?
          </strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            MW: Correct. As a reward to some of my collectors who originally minted on AB, I decided to split three-letter types into their own respective collection. 
            There were fifty-five YoursTruly hashes created that were put into a script which then selected winners from the DH minters list. 
            So each YoursTruly chose its owner. All letters, no matter the collection, have a special place in my heart; but those three styles are definitely my favorites.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <p><strong>
            CG: I see, that's super neat. I love those encrypted letters. So, are both collections part of the same project?
          </strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            MW: Thank you! Yeah, they are both part of the same series.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <p><strong>
            CG: Interesting choice to do it that way, air-drops are always fun and welcome. But let's talk a bit about your new project; 
            Where The Wind Blows. (WTWB) How did you come up with the title?
          </strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            MW: I think I just casually said it to myself as I was working on a feature of the collection. After realizing what I said it just stuck. 
            Mainly because of its poetic/subliminal tone, and it also just happened to relate with the nautical style.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <p><strong>
            CG: Most definitely, it is such a fitting title. Going where the wind blows is indeed how I feel about certain crypto prices right now. 
            I looked over the test mints you shared, and I must say the Nautical style is pretty sweet. Can you tell me more about it?
          </strong></p>
        </div>

       <div class="answer">
          <p>
            MW: The nautical style is the main style that drove the project forward. In this style the sails use the international maritime signal flags as their main patterns. 
            There are other styles with other patterns and colors but the Nautical style is the only style that uses those flag patterns. Also, in this style there are two different possible ways that they can be generated. 
            Those being "day", and "night", which contribute to the nautical theme.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <p><strong>
            CG: The patterns did seem familiar but I had no clue they were part of the maritime signal flags.
            I also noticed some brighter styles. What were those about?
          </strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            MW: After looking at many Nautical outputs, I realized I wanted to expand the styles and create some contrast against all the mints. So I added two other styles: "RNG", and "Fixed". 
            RNG's main goal was to create gradients that were more generative. That means the primary and secondary colors are very flexible and can range from subtle pastels to super saturated colors. 
            The "Fixed" style has a set of fixed color styles, which contribute some more rare color styles. The goal in creating these three categories was not only to explore a vast range of outputs but also be able to resonate with a larger audience. 
            Some bright and playful, some subtle and calm, and others more realistic and true to the nautical theme.
          </p>
        </div>

        
        <div class="question">
          <p><strong>CG: Do you have a favorite category or feature style?
          </strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            MW: Ouch! That's like picking a favorite child. If I had to choose, there is a feature category called Solstice, and I can't wait to see what it generates. But I also do have a couple nautical favorites. 
          </p>
        </div>


        <div class="question">
          <p><strong>
            CG: You heard it here first folks, Solstice and Nautical be looking rare. If I could circle back to the Nautical styles, what do the signal flags actually mean?
          </strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            MW: I actually did research and realized that they don't only spell things as there is one flag for every letter of the alphabet. But they also have their own meanings to be able to communicate to nearby vessels.
            For instance, the "A" aka "Alpha" flag warns other vessels that there is a diver underwater so they could steer clear. Or "W" aka "Whiskey" means someone on the vessel needs medical assistance. 
            They are all very usefull if you know the meanings.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
          <p><strong>CG: That's actually pretty fascinating, I'll likely go down the nautical flag rabit whole. 
            It has been a great chat ModnarWolf. Hope to ha you back here some day and I look forward to 
            seeing the mints and how it all evolves. 
          </strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            MW: The pleasure was mine, hope we can do this again sometime.
